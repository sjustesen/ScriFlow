# The Scriflow Client App

To get the app running, you'll need to grab any dependencies first.
so issue `npm install` in this directory

After the process is complete, you can start the project with

`npm start`

Afterwards, you need to go to the server/build directory and start the server, `./scriflow`.

# Windows or MacOS?
If you're on Windows or MacOS, you may need to recompile the Scriflow binary. 
Go to `server/src` and issue `go build` in a terminal. For convinience, place the binary in the build directory.
(sorry about the cumbersome manual steps, we'll provide better build methods later on ;-))
